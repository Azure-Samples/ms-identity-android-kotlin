#### Choose the Microsoft Entra tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) using either a work or school account or a personal Microsoft account.
1. If your account is present in more than one Microsoft Entra tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory**.
   Change your portal session to the desired Microsoft Entra tenant.

#### Register the Android-Kotlin app (Android Kotlin)

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. When the **Register an application page** appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `Android Kotlin`.
   - Change **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com)**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. On the app **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
1. From the app's Overview page, select the **Authentication** section.
   - In the **Redirect URIs** | **Suggested Redirect URIs for public clients (mobile, desktop)** section, check **the option of the form msal&lt;clientId&gt;://auth**
1. Select **Save**.
1. Select the **API permissions** section
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, ensure that the right permissions are checked: **User.Read**. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button

### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Microsoft Entra tenant

In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".
