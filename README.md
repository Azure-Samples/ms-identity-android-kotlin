## About the Sample

The MSAL Android library gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddev) by supporting [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

This sample walks you through the process of integrating authentication with Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly Microsoft Entra ID for developers) in your android application. In this sample we'd walk you through the code you need to write in the various lifecycle events of your app to achieve the following objectives.

* Sign-in a user
* Device-wide SSO and Conditional Access support through the Auth Broker
* Select between Single Account Mode and Multiple Account Mode
* Get a token for the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Call the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Sign out the user

## Scenario

This sample app is a [multi-tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/setup-multi-tenant-app) app, which means that it can sign-in users from any Microsoft Entra tenant and Microsoft Accounts.  It also demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview).
During the auth flow, the users will be required to sign-in first, if it is their first time signing-in to the app, the user would be asked to consent to the [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent) required by the application.

The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to sign-in an end user and make a call to the Microsoft Graph to get basic information about the signed-in user.

## Broker Authentication using MSAL

Microsoft provides applications for every mobile platform that allow for the bridging credentials across applications from different vendors and for enhanced features that require a single secure place from where to validate credentials. These applications are called Brokers. The brokers available for Android are **Microsoft Authenticator** and **Company Portal**.
[Learn more about Brokers here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/brokered-auth)

The MSAL for Android will automatically use the broker if they are present on the device.

> **Note:**
> If you have older versions of **Microsoft Authenticator** or **Company Portal** App installed in the device where this sample application will be run, then the user might not be able to test the scenarios presented here. Please make sure that you have installed the latest version of Microsoft Authenticator or Company Portal on your device.

### Single Account Mode

In the `Single Account` Mode, only one user can sign into the application at a time. If the app wants to support just one signed-in user, it is recommended to use the `Single Account` Mode.

The following code snippet from **SingleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set to the `Single Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(
    getContext(),
    R.raw.auth_config_single_account);
```

In the **auth_config_single_account.json** file, the `account_mode` is set as following:

```json
"account_mode" : "SINGLE",
```

#### Single Account Mode with Shared Device Mode

`Shared Device` Mode will allow you to configure Android devices to be shared by multiple employees, while providing Microsoft Identity backed management of the device. Employees will be able to sign-in to their devices and access customer information quickly. When they are finished with their shift or task, they will be able to globally Sign-Out of the device and it will be immediately ready for the next employee to use.

![Flowchart](ReadmeFiles/shareddeviceflowchart.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Applications that run on Shared Devices must be in Single Account Mode. Applications that only support Multiple Account Mode will not run on a Shared Device.

In the code, you can use the `isSharedDevice()` flag to determine if an application is in the Shared Device Mode. Your app can use this flag to modify UX accordingly.

Code snippet from **SingleAccountModeFragment** class showing usage of the `isSharedDevice()` flag:

```Java
deviceModeTextView.setText(mSingleAccountApp.isSharedDevice() ? "Shared" : "Non-Shared");
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can only [put a device in to Shared Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/tutorial-v2-shared-device-mode#set-up-an-android-device-in-shared-mode) using the [Authenticator app](https://www.microsoft.com/account/authenticator) and with a user who is in the [Cloud Device Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#cloud-device-administrator) role. You can configure the membership of your Organizational Roles by going to the Microsoft Entra admin center and selecting:
>
> Microsoft Entra ID -> Roles and Administrators -> Cloud Device Administrator  

## Multiple Account Mode

In the `Multiple Account` Mode, the application supports multiple accounts and can switch between user accounts and get data from that user's account.

Code snippet from **MultipleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set in the `Multiple Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
    R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account);
```

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

* Android SDK
* An internet connection
* a Microsoft Entra tenant. For more information on how to get a Microsoft Entra tenant, see [How to get a Microsoft Entra tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
* One or more user accounts in your Microsoft Entra tenant.

## Steps to Run the app

> This sample ships with a default `redirect_uri` configured in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. In order for the default `redirect_uri` to work, this project must be built with the `debug.keystore` located in the `gradle/` directory. To configure signing in Android Studio, see [Sign Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

### Step 1: Clone the code

  From your shell or command line:

```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-android-kotlin.git
  ```

   The following steps have been carried out for android studio, but you can choose and work with any editor of your choice.

   Open Android Studio, and select *open an existing Android Studio project*. Find the cloned project and open it.

### Step 2: Run the sample

From menu, select *Run* > *Run 'app'*. Once the app launches,

1. Click on the hamburger icon

    * Single Account: Select this to explore Single Account Mode

    * Multiple Account: Select this to explore Multiple Account Mode.

2. Click on sign-in, it takes you to `add account` page.

3. Add one or more accounts as per the device mode, and sign in with your test account.

4. Once successfully signed-in, basic user details will be displayed.

To explore more about the application, follow on screen options.

> This sample application is configured to run out-of-the-box. To register your own application and run the sample with those settings, follow below steps.

## Register your Own Application (Optional)  

To begin registering your app, start at the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aka.ms/MobileAppReg)

To **create** an app registration,  

1. Click `New Registration`.

2. Name your app, select the audience you're targeting, and click `Register`.

3. In the `Overview` > `Sign in users in 5 minutes` > `Android`.
    * Click on `Make this changes for me`.
    * Enter the Package Name from your Android Manifest.
    * Generate a Signature Hash. Follow the instructions in the portal.

4. Hit the `Make updates` button. Note the ***MSAL Configuration*** as it is used later in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `auth_config.json`.

**Configure** the sample application with your app registration by replacing the sample code in `auth_config.json` and `AndroidManifest.xml`

1. Copy and paste the ***MSAL Configuration*** JSON from the Microsoft Entra admin center into `auth_config.json`.

2. Inside the `AndroidManifest.xml`, replace `android:host` and `android:path` with the same info saved in above step.
        - `auth_config.json` contains this information as a reference inside the `redirect_uri` field.
        - The Signature Hash should NOT be URL encoded in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    Refer [Microsoft Entra ID Android Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-android) for more details

From menu, select *Build* > *Clean Project* and *Run* > *Run 'app'*.

## About the code

The following code fragments walk through features that MSAL can implement.

### SingleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Single Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication, obtaining the token, and making a Graph API call using the obtained token.

   The following steps give you more details.

1. Create a SingleAccount PublicClientApplication:
    ```java
    PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(
        context as Context,
        R.raw.auth_config_single_account,
        object : IPublicClientApplication.ISingleAccountApplicationCreatedListener {
            override fun onCreated(application: ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication) {
            }

            override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {
            }
        })
    ```

2. Signing in a user:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.signIn(activity as Activity, "", getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

3. Acquiring token:
    * Interactive:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.acquireToken(activity!!, getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

    * Silent:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(), AUTHORITY, getAuthSilentCallback())
    ```

4. Calling Graph API to get basic user details and displaying data:
    ```java
    private fun callGraphAPI(authenticationResult: IAuthenticationResult) {
        MSGraphRequestWrapper.callGraphAPIWithVolley(
            context as Context,
            msgraph_url.text.toString(),
            authenticationResult.accessToken,
            Response.Listener<JSONObject> { response ->
                /* Successfully called graph, process data and send to UI */
                Log.d(TAG, "Response: $response")
                displayGraphResult(response)
            },
            Response.ErrorListener { error ->
                Log.d(TAG, "Error: $error")
                displayError(error)
            })
    }
    ```

5. Sign-out:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.signOut(object : ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication.SignOutCallback {
        override fun onSignOut() {
        }

        override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {
        }
    });
    ```  

    When sign-out is performed it removes the signed-in account and cached tokens from this app.

### MultipleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Multiple Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication, obtaining the token, and making a Graph API call using the obtained token.

1. Create a MultipleAccount PublicClientApplication:

    ```java
    PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(
        context as Context,
        R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account,
        object : IPublicClientApplication.IMultipleAccountApplicationCreatedListener {
            override fun onCreated(application: IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication) {
                mMultipleAccountApp = application
            }

            override fun onError(error: MsalException){
            }
        });
    ```

2. Acquiring token:

    * Interactive:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp!!.acquireToken(activity as Activity, getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

    * Silent:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(),
        accountList.get(accountListSpinner.getSelectedItemPosition()),
            AUTHORITY,
            getAuthSilentCallback());
    ```

3. Get Accounts:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp!!.acquireTokenSilentAsync(
                getScopes(),
                accountList!![account_list.selectedItemPosition],
                AUTHORITY,
                getAuthSilentCallback()
            )
    ```

4. Remove account:
    ```java
     mMultipleAccountApp!!.removeAccount(
        accountList!![account_list.selectedItemPosition],
        object : IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication.RemoveAccountCallback {
            override fun onRemoved() {

            }

            override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {

            }
        })
    ```
