# Use MSAL in an Android app to sign-in users and call Microsoft Graph

| [Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/guidedsetups/active-directory-android)| [Library](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-android) | [API Reference](http://javadoc.io/doc/com.microsoft.identity.client/msal) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support)
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## About the Sample

The MSAL Android library gives your app the ability to begin using the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddev) by supporting [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com) in a converged experience using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.

This sample walks you through the process of integrating authentication with Microsoft Identity Platform (formerly Azure Active Directory for developers) in your android application. In this sample we'll walk you through the code you need to write in the various lifecycle events of your app to achieve the following objectives.

* Sign-in a user
* Device-wide SSO and Conditional Access support through the Auth Broker
* Select between Single Account Mode and Multiple Account Mode
* Get a token for the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Call the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com)
* Sign out the user

## Scenario

This sample app is a [multi-tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/setup-multi-tenant-app) app, which means that it can sign-in users from any Azure AD tenant and Microsoft Accounts.  It also demonstrates how a developer can build apps to connect with enterprise users and access their Azure + O365 data via [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview).
During the auth flow, the users will be required to sign-in first, if it's their first time signing-in to the app, the user would be asked to consent to the [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-permissions-and-consent) required by the application.

The majority of the logic in this sample shows how to sign-in an end user and make a call to the Microsoft Graph to get basic information about the signed-in user.

## Broker Authentication using MSAL

Microsoft provides applications for every mobile platform that allow for the bridging of credentials across applications from different vendors and for enhanced features that require a single secure place from where to validate credentials. These are called brokers. The brokers available for Android are **Microsoft Authenticator** and **Company Portal**.
[Learn more about Brokers here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/brokered-auth)

The MSAL for Android will automatically use the broker if they are present on the device.

> If you have older versions of **Microsoft Authenticator** app or [Company portal app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune-user-help/install-and-sign-in-to-the-intune-company-portal-app-ios) installed in the device where this sample application will be run, then the user might not be able to test the scenarios presented here. Please make sure that you have installed the latest version of Microsoft Authenticator or Company Portal on your device.

### Single Account Mode

In the `Single Account` Mode, only one user can sign into the application at a time. If the app wants to support just one signed-in user, it is recommended to use the `Single Account` Mode.

The following code snippet from **SingleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set to the `Single Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(
    getContext(),
    R.raw.auth_config_single_account);
```

In the **auth_config_single_account.json** file, the `account_mode` is set as following:

```json
"account_mode" : "SINGLE",
```

## Multiple Account Mode

In the `Multiple Account` Mode, the application supports multiple accounts and can switch between user accounts and get data from that user's account.

Code snippet from **MultipleAccountModeFragment** class shows how the application is set in the `Multiple Account` Mode in the code:

```java
PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(getContext(),
    R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account);
```

## How to run this sample

To run this sample, you'll need:

* Android SDK
* An internet connection
* An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
* One or more user accounts in your Azure AD tenant.

## Steps to Run the app

> This sample ships with a default `redirect_uri` configured in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. In order for the default `redirect_uri` to work, this project must be built with the `debug.keystore` located in the `gradle/` directory. To configure signing in Android Studio, see [Sign Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing).

### Step 1: Clone the code

  From your shell or command line:

```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-android-kotlin.git
  ```

   The following steps have been carried out for android studio, but you can choose and work with any editor of your choice.

   Open Android Studio, and select *open an existing Android Studio project*. Find the cloned project and open it.

### Step 2: Run the sample

From menu, select *Run* > *Run 'app'*. Once the app launches,

1. Click on the hamburger icon

    * Single Account: Select this to explore Single Account Mode

    * Multiple Account: Select this to explore Multiple Account Mode.

2. Click on sign-in, it takes you to `add account` page.

3. Add one or more accounts as per the device mode, and sign in with your test account.

4. Once successfully signed-in, basic user details will be displayed.

To explore more about the application, follow on screen options.

> This sample application is configured to run out-of-the-box. To register your own application and run the sample with those settings, follow below steps.

## Register your Own Application (Optional)  

To begin registering your app, start at the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/MobileAppReg)

To **create** an app registration,  

1. Click `New Registration`.

2. Name your app, select the audience you're targeting, and click `Register`.

3. In the `Overview` > `Sign in users in 5 minutes` > `Android`.
    * Click on `Make this changes for me`.
    * Enter the Package Name from your Android Manifest. In the context of current sample, please update the package name as  `com.azuresamples.msalandroidkotlinapp`. 
    * Enter the Signature Hash. As mentioned in the Note section of **Steps to run the sample**, sample is using the `debug.keystore` from the project folder under gradle. Since signature hash `1wIqXSqBj7w+h11ZifsnqwgyKrY=` is preconfigured in the sample, please upate the same value under the Signature Hash field of  Azure portal. If you want to use the different `debug.keystore` then, please follow the instructions in the portal to generate Signature hash..

4. Hit the `Make updates` button. Note the ***MSAL Configuration*** as it is used later in `AndroidManifest.xml`, `auth_config_single_account.json` and `auth_config_multiple_account.json`.

**Configure** the sample application with your app registration by replacing the sample code in `AndroidManifest.xml`, `auth_config_single_account.json` and `auth_config_multiple_account.json`

1. Copy and paste the ***MSAL Configuration*** JSON from the Azure portal into `auth_config_single_account.json` and `auth_config_multiple_account.json` files under the res\raw folder. While pasting, you can exclude the first line `com.azuresamples.msalandroidappandroid:host="com.azuresamples.msalandroidkotlinapp"`and update only the valid JSON content. 

2. Inside the `AndroidManifest.xml`, replace `android:host` and `android:path` with the same info saved in above step.
        - `auth_config_single_account.json` and `auth_config_multiple_account.json` contains this information as a reference inside the `redirect_uri` field.
        - The Signature Hash should NOT be URL encoded in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    Refer [Azure Active Directory Android Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-android) for more details

From menu, select *Build* > *Clean Project* and *Run* > *Run 'app'*.

## About the code

The following code fragments walk through features that MSAL can implement.

### SingleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Single Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication, obtaining the token, and making a Graph API call using the obtained token.

   The following steps give you more details.

1. Create a SingleAccount PublicClientApplication:
    ```java
    PublicClientApplication.createSingleAccountPublicClientApplication(
        context as Context,
        R.raw.auth_config_single_account,
        object : IPublicClientApplication.ISingleAccountApplicationCreatedListener {
            override fun onCreated(application: ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication) {
            }

            override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {
            }
        })
    ```

2. Signing in a user:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.signIn(activity as Activity, "", getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

3. Acquiring token:
    * Interactive:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.acquireToken(activity!!, getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

    * Silent:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(), AUTHORITY, getAuthSilentCallback())
    ```

4. Calling Graph API to get basic user details and displaying data:
    ```java
    private fun callGraphAPI(authenticationResult: IAuthenticationResult) {
        MSGraphRequestWrapper.callGraphAPIWithVolley(
            context as Context,
            msgraph_url.text.toString(),
            authenticationResult.accessToken,
            Response.Listener<JSONObject> { response ->
                /* Successfully called graph, process data and send to UI */
                Log.d(TAG, "Response: $response")
                displayGraphResult(response)
            },
            Response.ErrorListener { error ->
                Log.d(TAG, "Error: $error")
                displayError(error)
            })
    }
    ```

5. Sign-out:
    ```java
    mSingleAccountApp!!.signOut(object : ISingleAccountPublicClientApplication.SignOutCallback {
        override fun onSignOut() {
        }

        override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {
        }
    });
    ```  

    When sign-out is performed it removes the signed-in account and cached tokens from this app.

### MultipleAccountModeFragment class

   Contains code showing how the `Multiple Account` Mode is implemented. The includes authentication, obtaining the token, and making a Graph API call using the obtained token.

1. Create a MultipleAccount PublicClientApplication:

    ```java
    PublicClientApplication.createMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication(
        context as Context,
        R.raw.auth_config_multiple_account,
        object : IPublicClientApplication.IMultipleAccountApplicationCreatedListener {
            override fun onCreated(application: IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication) {
                mMultipleAccountApp = application
            }

            override fun onError(error: MsalException){
            }
        });
    ```

2. Acquiring token:

    * Interactive:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp!!.acquireToken(activity as Activity, getScopes(), getAuthInteractiveCallback())
    ```

    * Silent:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp.acquireTokenSilentAsync(getScopes(),
        accountList.get(accountListSpinner.getSelectedItemPosition()),
            AUTHORITY,
            getAuthSilentCallback());
    ```

3. Get Accounts:
    ```java
    mMultipleAccountApp!!.acquireTokenSilentAsync(
                getScopes(),
                accountList!![account_list.selectedItemPosition],
                AUTHORITY,
                getAuthSilentCallback()
            )
    ```

4. Remove account:
    ```java
     mMultipleAccountApp!!.removeAccount(
        accountList!![account_list.selectedItemPosition],
        object : IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication.RemoveAccountCallback {
            override fun onRemoved() {

            }

            override fun onError(exception: MsalException) {

            }
        })
    ```
